Quantitative (ML) financial risk management tool. The machine learning tool can be applied for investors actively trading cryptocurrencies. The idea is to use tested models in finance to introduce probability based risk management models for decision makers. This is to say that layman without touchbase to mathematics are able to make better decisions faster. This takes the unwanted layer out of the chain of command in political/business decision making where there is somesort of powerpoint-consultant/middle management in between of the data and the C-level. 

# 1. Bernoulli
# 2. Fourier
 - Fourier transformation: inflation rates
 - Sine wave for cyclicality
# 3. Markov
- Divides stock price movements to UPs and DOWNs. Returns a fourfold table which gives probabilities for price movements today based on historical price movements.
- Looks if lognormal daily returns are one, two, or three standard deviations away from the expected value and calculate the associated probabilities respectively.
# 4. Bayes
# 5. Kelly
- The Kelly criterion
# 6. Black–Scholes–Merton
